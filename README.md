# Modelling the system of an agricultural cooperative
## Miniproject Organisation
- all the code is in the app/src/main/java/miniproject directory
- the main is contained in app/src/main/java/miniproject/app/App.java
- The configuration parameters are in app/src/main/java/miniproject/config/Config.java
- A sample database for the farmers and the malls are in app/src/main/resources


## Miniproject Objective
The objective is to model the system of an agricultural cooperative and simulate its operation: In a cooperative, several producers deliver their goods in a common warehouse. The warehouse has necessarily a limited size. Farmers deliver at a different frequency between 1 and 5 times a week. Deliveries can be of different sizes. The cooperative has several trucks that operate in 24/7 to load the goods from the warehouse and deliver it to different destinations in Europe (hypermarkets). The delivery time of the truck depends on its destination. 

The objective is to model this system and then simulate its operation over a specified period (several months) with different parameters: Number of farmers, Size of warehouse, Min and max capacity of trucks Number of trucks We can just log each delivery in the warehouse or to a hypermarket
